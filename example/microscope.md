# The OpenFlexure Microscope

## Description
The OpenFlexure Microscope is a high-performance microscope, including fine translation stage, computer control, and various options for the optics.  It's designed to be able to do many of the experiments you can perform on a fully motorised research microscope, at a fraction of the cost.  We very much hope it will become the basis of more sophisticated designs.
