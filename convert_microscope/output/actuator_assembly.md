# Actuator assembly
An actuator, based on an M3 screw, brass nut, and elastic bands, that can precisely and repeatably move a plastic flexure mechanism.

This assembly is used to actuate each of the three axes of the OpenFlexure Microscope stage.  It consists of a plastic gear that fits onto an M3 screw, which then pulls up on a brass nut.  Elastic bands pull down on the nut, tensioning the system.  This confers two benefits: firstly, it allows us to actuate the flexure mechanism both up and down - doubling the travel - and secondly, it eliminates much of the backlash from the system.

# Assembly Instructions
## Step
There are three of these actuators on the microscope: these steps should be followed for each one in turn.  Note the quantities in the parts list are for one actuator, and they don't include the microscope body.  The image for this steps shows everything you will need to assemble the three actuators (NB the illumination arm is not yet needed, and the band insertion tool is now longer and double-ended).

## Step
We need to place a nut inside each actuator.  Insert it from the side, through the slot in the actuator column, and push it into place with the tool.  Take care to insert the nut corner-first (i.e. with flat sides parallel to the tool), otherwise it will jam.

## Step
Next, put one of the hex-head screws into the gear, and put a washer on the screw thread underneath the gear.  Put a very small blob of grease (if available) on the screw thread. Insert the screw into the hole at the top of the column, and screw it into the nut that is now inside the actuator.  Use a washer between the gear and the microscope body.

## Step
Turn the microscope over and, using the elastic band tool or a craft knife, snap the two thin plastic supports as shown if they are present.

## Step

Hook one of the Viton (or rubber) bands over the elastic band tool, and insert it through the foot.  You should end up with one loop of elastic band passing over each fork-shaped end of the insertion tool.  The flat side of the tool should be on the outside, so that the channels in either end face towards the centre of the foot.

 
You may find it easier to put the band through the foot, then insert the tool and hook the band over either end - either way you should end up with the band, foot, and tool arranged as shown in the pictures.

## Step

Place the foot on the body, taking care that it's in the right place (the tilted ones are for the outer two actuators, the flat one is for the centre) and the right way round (the open part of the foot points towards the optics module in the centre of the microscope).

 
Push the insertion tool in until the band clicks into place.  You may find it helps to push on the gear or use the nut insertion tool to hold the actuator in place while you do this.  It should click twice, once for each side.  If you don't manage to hook both sides on, you may need to completely remove the band and try again - a wooden skewer, long awl, or small flat-bladed screwdriver works well to unhook the band without damaging it.

 
What's happening here is that the elastic band is pushed over little hooks inside the actuator column, near the top, and the click is the band popping into place.  The band pulls down on the actuator, so after it's in place the gear should turn with a little more resistance - this is important for the microscope to work properly.

## Step
You should now have the band pulling both sides of the actuator down as shown.  If you used a long elastic band, you can break the thin layer at the bottom of the foot on either side, to pull the band out and wrap it around the foot to tighten it.  This is not necessary for the Viton bands, or if you're using doubled-over #32 bands.

## Step
Congratulations, you've assembled the actuator!  There are three to do, so you may now need to go back and make the next one.
