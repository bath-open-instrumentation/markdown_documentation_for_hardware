# Illumination Arm with Condenser
A holder for an LED and lens to take images in transmitted light.

The illumination arm holds an LED above the sample, with a condenser lens.  It will get higher resolution and brightness.  There is a screw holding the two parts together, which goes through a slot to allow simple, slip plate style adjustment of the condenser alignment.  There is also a simpler [fixed arm](./illumination_arm_fixed) holding a single LED.

# Assembly Instructions
## Step
To build the condenser, you will need the two parts of the mounting arm, an M3 screw and washer, the cable, LED, and lens, and the condenser housing.  You will also need the printed lens insertion tool to put the lens into the holder.

## Step
Place the condenser lens on the insertion tool (flat side down), and push the condenser housing down onto it.  Take care to keep it vertical.  You may need to push fairly hard.  As with the tube lens in the optics module, check it's flat and push again if necessary.

## Step
Insert the LED into the condenser housing.  It should push-fit and stay in place.  It can be glued if it doesn't stay in.

## Step
Assemble the cable for the LED.  If using pre-crimped cables, as supplied with our kit, fit the 2-way header to either end.  Don't worry about polarity, it's easy and harmless to simply rotate the connector 180 degrees if you need to.

## Step
Thread the cable through the mounting arm as shown.  It's much easier to do this before assembling the arm.

## Step
Screw the horizontal part of the mounting arm onto the vertical part.  The hole should be about the right size for an M3 screw to self-tap.

## Step
Connect the LED to the cable by pushing the legs into the 2-way housing.

## Step
Slide the condenser housing onto the dovetail clip at the end of the arm.  Wiggling it from side to side might help if it's stiff.

## Step
Fit the illumination arm to the microscope by sliding it onto the dovetail from underneath.  The thin linker between the two sides of the clip may snap - this is not a problem, it's there only for support during printing..
